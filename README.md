# 🏝️ Treasure Island - Python Text Adventure Game

Welcome to **Treasure Island**, a fun **Python text-based adventure game** where your mission is to find the hidden treasure.  
At each step, you make choices that will determine whether you survive, win, or face *Game Over*.  

This project uses **Python’s random module** to create different outcomes, making the game fun and unpredictable every time you play. 🎲

- Only **one path leads to the treasure** 🏆
